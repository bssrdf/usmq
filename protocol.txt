The protocol for the mq will be extremely simple:

Message producers will use the following:

    PUT\r\n<head>\r\n<nbytes>\r\n<body>\r\n

which will add the message to the queue.

Message consumers will use the following:

    GET\r\n

which will grab the oldest message on the queue.

Or:

    MATCH\r\n<head>\r\n

which will grab the oldest message on the queue with the given "head" value.
