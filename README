This directory contains source code for a very simple message queueing system.

The purpose of this mq is just to explore libevent using C.

You'll need to install libevent2. The code was compiled using libevent-2.0.10-stable, which you can get here: http://monkey.org/~provos/libevent/.

You can build the code using SCons (http://www.scons.org/), simply run the "scons" command. If you don't have SCons and don't want to install it, you can compile the code as follows:

gcc -o ablinklist.o -c -g -Wall ablinklist.c
gcc -o ablinklist_imp.o -c -g -Wall ablinklist_imp.c
gcc -o mq.o -c -g -Wall mq.c
gcc -o mq mq.o ablinklist.o -levent

To run the message queue:

> mq 

You can specify the port (by default it's 8788):

> mq -p 9090

and levels of verbosity:

> mq -v
> mq -vv
